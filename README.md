# titato - a command line game
This is a small command line tic-tac-toe game written in Kotlin.

The challenge was to code it as clean as possible. 

## Why is it "clean code"?
* reduced complexity by breaking down the logic in several functions
* speaking and describing function and variable names
* consistence in naming 
* named classes after implementation
* methods are basically only do one thing
* encapsulated conditionals
* as less function arguments as possible 
* less "magic values" - they are extracted as constants
* ... and much more :) 

## Running the game 
Clone the project, open a command shell of choice. cd to the project root folder and run: 
``  mvn clean install exec:java `` 

Have fun :)
