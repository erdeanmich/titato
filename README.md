# titato - a command line game
This is a small command line tic-tac-toe game written in Kotlin.

The challenge was to code it as clean as possible. 

## Running the game 
Clone the project, open a command shell of choice. cd to the project root folder and run: 
``  mvn clean install exec:java `` 

Have fun :)
